Musical Time Machine (YouTube Music Version)

This project creates a playlist of the Billboard Hot 100 songs for a given date.

Originally, it was built using the Spotify Web API, but due to frequent issues with Spotify Developer services (dashboard downtime and authorization failures), the project was switched to YouTube Music using ytmusicapi.

How it works:

1) User enters a date (YYYY-MM-DD)
2) Scrapes Billboard Hot 100 songs
3) Creates a YouTube Music playlist
4) Adds the songs automatically
